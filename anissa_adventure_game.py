choice_plane = "As the pilot gets the plane started the weather begins to get bad. He reassures you that everything will be fine so you get in. As the plane is going down the runway you hear a terrible bang and the small plane shakes violently. Suddenly you are in the air. \
    The ride is bumpy and you can't wait to land. You finally see a small clearing where the plane can land. As the plane touches down it begins to spin out of control. You realize the bang you heard and the shaking during take-off must have been an accident that caused one \
    of the wheels to break off. The plane comes to a stop. Relieved that nobody was hurt badly you get off the plane. You are so happy to have arrived! After looking around and seeing nothing but forrest, you realize you still haven't made it to the site. The pilot then\
     approaches you and tells you that the valley is on the other side of the mountain range. In order to get to the other side of the mountains, you must go through a cave system. There are two ways through: you can either SWIM through a submerged cave, or CLIMB through\
     the underground taverns."
choice_raft = "The pilot gives you a hand drawn map of the river and points out the best place to get out before you go over the waterfall. You walk over to the raft and gear up. At first the river is narrow and rocky. It is difficult keeping the raft from\
    scraping the rocks and getting stuck along the bank. Then the current begins to pick up. You hit two large rapid runs. The second one almost sent you overboard. You are relieved to see the place the pilot showed you on the map. You pull the raft out\
    of the river and lay down on the bank to rest. When you get up, you see three piles of gear. There are three ways to get pass the waterfall. One is to HIKE down the steep mountain side, another is to use ropes\
    to DECEND the sheer cliff, or to go down on the ZIPLINE."
choice_canoe = "The pilot gives you a small hand drawn map of the river and shows you the best place to get out of the river before you go over the waterfall. You get into the canoe and begin to follow the river. It is a little shallow and narrow at this point, but is just fine \
    for the canoe. You do great. Then, it start getting a little rough but you are able to get through. You see rapids coming up that you won't be able to get through. You have to go to the bank, take out the canoe and carry it along the riverbank till you pass them by on foot.\
     Once you have gone past the rapids you are able to put the canoe back in the river and continue onward. This happens one more time before you arrive at the designated place marked on the map. As soon as you can, you pull your canoe out. You look around and notice three piles\
    of gear. There are three ways to get down the mountain around the waterfall. One is to HIKE down the steep side, another is to use the ropes to DECEND the sheer cliff, or you could take the ZIPLINE."
choice_helicopter = "As the pilot starts up the helicopter the wind begins to pick up. You ask if it will be a problem, but are reassured that it won't be. Once you take off, the pilot informs you that he will take you up toward the top of the mountain and drop you off near a river. \
    From there you will need to work your way down to the valley. You notice the higher the helicopter goes the bumpier the ride is. By the time you see the river, you feel like you are hanging on for dear life. It is then that the pilot tells you that he wont be able\
    to land. You will have to jump into the river and swim to the bank. Somebody will be waiting for you there. You spot the person, and jump. You swim to the bank, get out of the river and go over to the your guide. The guide points to the river and\
    you see a CANOE and a white water RAFT, both filled with gear. The guide explains to you that you will need to follow the river down the mountain to a point marked on a map he gives you."
choice_cave_swim = "You put on the wet suit and air tanks. The pilot tells you to follow a string that marks the best route through the caves. He also tells you to watch for sharp edges along the walls so you don't puncture your tanks. There is an alarm on the dive watch. When\
     it goes off, you will be half way through. At that point there is only enough air left to return, or continue to the end of the cave. He says it's an easy swim and there are only a couple tight areas, but you should get by them with out any problems. So, you double check\
     your gear and dive in. The water is a little murky, but clear enough to see. You are comfortable with the conditions. As you get further in, you come to an underwater arch that seems a little narrow. When you get closer you see that you have enough room to pass\
     through even with your tanks on. The alarm on your dive gear goes off. The pilot had told you that there would be a couple 'tight' places, but the archway wasn't tight at all. You decide to go on. After all, on this side of the arch the cave seems to have opened up even more. It\
    has opened up so much, you can no longer see any walls. You hold a little tighter on the guide string. You look at the dive watch. You are about 3/4 of the way done. When you look up you see a wall. The string leads straight to it, right up to a small hole. There is no way you can\
    through with your tanks. Then you remember you are limited on air. You start to feel panic coming on. You decide to take the tanks off your back and carry them along with a peice of cord that is attached to them. As you swim, you have to be careful not to kick up dirt and not to hit\
     the tanks against the rock walls. At one point you get stuck and really have to wiggle to get through. Just as suddenly as the wall appeared you are out of the cave and in a shallow pool. There standing next to it is an old shepherd with a herd of goats. As soon as you take off your mask\
     and gear, he tells you that he is there to guide you the rest of the way to the site. Then he asks you, 'Do you want to CARRY the injured goat, or GUIDE the flock?' "
choice_cave_climb = "Once you get to the cave you are given your gear and a piece of paper with directions. The pilot informs you that you will be going through by yourself, but the directions are easy to follow. He reassures you that the climb is easy enough as long as you are \
    cautious. After he gives you some tips about your gear. He looks at you quietly, then informs you that if you fall and are seriously injured, you are more likely to die than to be rescued. It would take the rest of the day before anyone realized anything was wrong. Then, it would\
    take days to get any type of rescue team over there, let alone find you. 'So, be careful!' Then he leaves. Certain he was just trying to scare you, you set off. After all, you are a decent hiker. You go into the cave a small distance and see that there is a small lake to one side of\
    it. You will have to be careful of wet rocks and slippery walls. You slowly make your way around the lake without any problems. You can see the cave opening running back into the mountain now. It begins to drop. It isn't steep enough to need a rope, but it will require you to\
    watch where you put your feet. It gets more damp the further you go. You are starting to get tired and are tripping over your feet more. You decide to take a short break. Then move on. At least the directions are easy to follow. Then you slip on the wet moss and cut\
     your leg. After you try to bandage it up, you notice it seems to be getting a little lighter. Sure enough you have reached the end. As you come out of the cave you see a herd of goats. Then an old shepherd comes around the side of the rock wall. As soon as he sees you he begins\
    to tell you that he is going to guide you the rest of the way to the site. Then he asks you, 'Do you want to CARRY the injured goat, or GUIDE the flock?'"
choice_donkey = "You have decided to ride the donkey the rest of the way. After a quick examination of the saddle, you have found a note from you uncle telling you to follow the narrow trail down the mountain. He can't wait to see you. The donkey seems friendly enough\
    so you begin immediately. It is nice to be able to ride and have a rest. The donkey knows the trail well and follows the switchbacks without any guidance from you. You begin to look around. It is beautifull. You notice a few small rock slides further along the \
    trail that you will need to be cautious with and even a pretty little creek. As you get close to the rock slides you decide to get off and cross them on foot, just in case the donkey slips. Both of those crossings go smoothly. You stop at the creek to let the donkey\
    get a drink before continuing. But, she doesn't seem to be thirsty. You get back on and urge her to cross the shallow creek. She doesn't budge. You dismount and try to lead her across. She will not approach the water. You resort to tugging and pulling. You even \
    give her a good hard push which results in her practically sitting down like a dog. You try different places to cross. But she is stubborn. After what seems like hours, you are tired and frustrated. You go back to pulling and tugging her lead. She finally \
    give in, lunging forward and knocking you clean off your feet.  A little dazed, you shakily stand up, brush off and climb back on. After a few more switchbacks you see some tents and movement in the distance."
choice_horse = "You decided to take the pretty, little mare. She is calm and sweet and seems to like attention- especially when you scratch that place on her neck. You explore the saddle bags and find a note from your uncle telling you to follow the narrow trail down the\
      mountain. He also mentions something about the prevoius owner always feeding the horse treats. That doesn't have anything to do with you so you pay no attention to it.  You mount up and head down trail. The mare is obedient and it only takes a light touch to guide her\
    As you make progress down the trail you come to a rock slide. At first you try to ride her through, but she struggles and starts to trip. So you get off and cross her on foot. Once across you go to mount her and she bites you. You try again, she bites you again. Then\
    you remember what your uncle said about the treats. You check your saddle bags. There is one cube of sugar. You offer it to her and she takes it. She seems happy. You try to get on and she lets without a problem. You continue on. You come to another rock slide. This time\
    you know exactly what to do. You dismount, go across the rocks slowly, then you go to the saddle bag for more sugar. You can't find any. Hoping she will understand you try to mount. She moves away and bites you. The next best thing you can think to do is \
    to scratch that place on her neck. You give it a try and it seems to make her happy. As you get back on, you glimpse a stream just a little further down. You can't help but dread that crossing. As you approach it, you get down. She immediately goes to it and\
    takes a drink. Then she just rubs up against you waiting for a scratch. So, you give her a scratch, get back on and urge her to cross. She crosses easily. Some time later, you see some tents in the distance."
choice_hike = "You have decided to hike to the bottom of the waterfall. You need to be carefull, it can get very steep. First you take a good look and try to pick out the best way down. Then you find a sturdy branch to use as a hiking stick. Once you find one you are satisfied with, you start\
    on your way down. Using the trees and shrubbery to help balance, you gradually work your way down. It is hard to keep your footing. You can't help slipping and stumbling. Once you had to climb down a tall tree to get past a sheer rock face. You often need to sit and slide down for short\
     distances at a time. About halfway down, you lost control and would have tumbled all of the way down if your walking stick hadn't gotten caught in the foilage. A little scratched and dusty you make it to the bottom of the waterfall. There, you see a DONKEY and a HORSE waiting."
choice_descend = "You put on the provided harness, set up the rope for descent, and gather the rest of the gear. You look over the edge of the cliff (trying not to think about how terrible it would be if you fell). You get an idea of a good pathway down. You also see an anchor\
     point nearby. That is the first place you go. You anchor in and look around. Maybe there are more anchors. You see that there are. They are mostly along the route you had planned. Some take you in a better direction than you had origianlly planned. You can see that the cliff side\
    has more loose rock than you expected. Along with that and the spray from the waterfall, you will have to be vary careful. You make your way to the next few anchors without any problems. Then, you hear the sound of falling rock, you hug the cliffside as tight as you can hoping they\
     will miss you. The rocks just graze your left hand. Looking up, you realize your rope had run across some of the loose rock above. Another thing for you to try to avoid. The rest of the way down you manage to avoid falling rocks, but you do slip a few times. Thank goodness for\
     the anchors! You finally reach the bottom and disconnect from the rope and take off the gear. You back away from the cliff and see a DONKEY and HORSE, both tied to a tree."
choice_zipline = "You have decided to take the zipline. This should be fun, easy, and fast! You put on the harness, other gear and hook up to the line. You can see a landing place from where you are. It looks like it is the halfway point, and where you will need to change directions\
    You get ready and push off. Zoom! You're at the landing before you know it. The ride was smooth and quick. You are so glad you chose the zipline. You can see the rest of the line takes you across the river, which seems odd, but must be right. Off you go! Zoom! That was fun.\
    You made it. 'Just in time!' you think to yourself, since you noticed the gear had begun to heat up. 'Good thing I'm done.' At least you thought so. There is no way to get down, and you notice one more line, longer, going back across the river through the trees, towards the base of the\
    waterfall. That makes more sense. You go ahead and start. About halfway across you can smell the metal and line getting hot. You know if it gets too hot the gear can break and you will fall. You are having second thoughts about taking the zipline. The smell continues to get stronger. \
    That is when you start going through the trees. They have overgrown the run. The branches whip you in the face. All you can do is hope for the best and try to meagerly protect yourself. Suddenly you come to an abrupt stop. You look out from behind your arms and see you have come to the end\
    of the line. You disconnect, never happier to be on solid ground. Then you notice a DONKEY and HORSE there waiting."
choice_carry_goat = "You have taken a look at the goats. The herd looked like it would be hard to handle so you have decided to carry the injured goat. The shepherd takes you over to it. It is one of the smaller adults. It's leg is swollen and has an open sore. Wow, do they all stink! \
    The shepherd calls to the goats and starts  guiding them. Carefully you pick up the injured goat and follow behind the herd. The goats all smell, but the one you have really stinks. The open sore is rancid. Flies are attracted to it. They buzz up your nose and get stuck in lyour hair. \
    Just when you think you can't take anymore, the goat relieves itself. You feel the warmth of the urine on your skin just before you smell it. You shout out and put the goat down. The shepherd turns around to see what is wrong. Then, he starts laughing. He tells you to go rinse your shirt\
    in a small stream you had just passed by while he tends to the goats wounds. As soon as you get back, the shepherd moves the herd on. Seeing there is nothing to do but pick up the goat and move on, that's what you do. As you come around some thick shrubbery you hear voices. "
choice_guide_herd = "Rather than carry a goat the rest of the way, you decide to guide the goats. The shepherd smiles, hands you his stick and picks up the injured goat. Then he simply beckons you to follow and heads off into the trees. You start to gather the goats together and move them\
    toward the shepherd. They follow the shepherd easily, probably out of habit. Pretty soon, one strays from the group. You go after it and guide it back, just to see another one wander off. This continues until the shepherd stops. He puts his goat down and tells you that you have lost \
    four goats along the way and you need to go find them while he tends to the injured goat's leg. Already tired from chasing the goats, you head back to find the strays. You are able to find them. One was stuck among thick shrubbery. After you managed to get him out all he did was try to \
    pull away from you. As soon as you return, the shepherd (having seen you dragging the goat) brings you a rope to lead the goat with. He then picks up the injured goat and moves on. The rope helps, but that goat still fights you the rest of the way. Whenever another goat strays, you need\
    to tie up the stubborn goat, guide the stray back to the herd, and continue to drag the stubborn one. As you come around thick shrubbery you hear voices."
